# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner but how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin their Data Science Journey. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.

Titanic Problem:

Based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic, that ended up killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons for such loss was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge you are requested to analyse data applying machine learning and predict which passenger survived the tragedy Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Data Insights:

Here are some insights we had analysing the Data.

• Pclass, Sex, Cabin and Embarked are Categorical features.
• Comparing Genders, Females are way more likely to survive.
• The fares didn't contribute much to the model
• We decided to unite Age and Pclass due to the correlation with results
• Names are unique in the dataset, so they are useless without preprocessing
• Dividing age feature by groups is important to improve Machine Learning performance.
